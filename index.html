          Hello! My name is Christina and I was born and raised in Jacksonville Florida. I am a first generation Vietnamese American and
          was raised by my parents and my grandma. I am bilingual and able to speak in both English and Vietnamese. My household not only include just
          my parents and grandma, but as well as my aunts, uncles and cousins. Given that I am an only child, I never really felt as though I was an only child,
          thanks to my cousins since they are like sisters to me. As a tradtion, my family likes to take road trips, or go on a cruise as a
          vacation. FUN FACT: It would always include at least all 16 of us.
        </p>

          I attended Wolfson High School, and during my high school years, I manage to join a few clubs and picked up some hobbies. I was in
          chorus and played softball. Ten years ago, my family adopted a golden doodle name Pippin who was just 2 years old from the humane society. Pippin
          is a friendly dog whom loves to be loved and adored by everyone.

          I recently just moved to Orlando to attend the University of Central Florida. Oringinly, I studied Pre Med and wanted to become a Dermatologist, but as I
          continued, I discovered that I would rather pursue a career that would allow me to explore my creative side.
